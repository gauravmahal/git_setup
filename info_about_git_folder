* Run git init command in the directory which you need to put into the git repository
    Then below .git directory is formed.
.Git Directory Contents
We're about to take a look at the .git directory...it's not vital for this course, though, so don't worry about memorizing anything, it's here if you want to dig a little deeper into how Git works under the hood.

Here's a brief synopsis on each of the items in the .git directory:

 * config file - where all project specific configuration settings are stored.
    From the Git Book:
 
    Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository you’re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository.
 
    For example, let's say you set that the global configuration for Git uses your personal email address. If you want your work email to be used for a specific project rather than your personal email, that change would be added to this file.
 
 * description file - this file is only used by the GitWeb program, so we can ignore it
 * hooks directory - this is where we could place client-side or server-side scripts that we can use to hook into Git's different lifecycle events
        * Git can be customised to git-enforced policy - like letting only certain user commits into the branch by using server-side hook
 * info directory - contains the global excludes file
 * objects directory - this directory will store all of the commits we make
 * refs directory - this directory holds pointers to commits (basically the "branches" and "tags")

* setting up git config username and email id
    # sets up Git with your name 
    $ git config --global user.name "Your name here"
    $ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
    # makes sure that Git output is colored
    $ git config --global color.ui true
    $ git config --global core.editor <any other editor>  
    # LF will be replaced by CRLF -- warning appeared 
    # In Unix systems the end of a line is represented with a line feed (LF). In windows a line is 
    # represented with a carriage return (CR) and a line feed (LF) thus (CRLF). when you get code 
    # from git that was uploaded from a unix system they will only have an LF.
    $ git config core.autocrlf false

* setting up ssh in computer
    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
    working with passphrase
    $ ssh-keygen -p

* adding ssh key to ssh-agent
    for manually
        # start the ssh-agent in the background
        $ eval $(ssh-agent -s)
        > Agent pid 59566

##############################  connecting git to git repository #############################

------ create a git repo -------
* git init - repository created
------ review a repo's history -------
* git clone <http://address>
* git status
    first thing to do every time 
* git log
    By default, this command displays:
        the SHA
        the author
        the date
        and the message
* git log --oneline
    short and concise
* git log --stat
    displays the file(s) that have been modified
    displays the number of lines that have been added/removed
    displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been added/removed
* git log -p [--patch]
    displays the files that have been modified
    displays the location of the lines that have been added/removed
    displays the actual changes that have been made 
    * git log -p <7_key_SHA>
    -w :  to ignore changes to whitespace
* git show similar to git log -p
    git log -show <7_key_SHA>
--------Add commit to a repo----------
$ git add <file1> <file2> … <fileN>
    This command:
        * is used to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index
        * takes a space-separated list of file names
        * alternatively, the period . can be used in place of a list of files to tell Git to add the current directory (and all nested files)
$ git commit
    * command takes files from the Staging Index and saves them in the repository
$ git diff
    * command is used to see changes that have been made but haven't been committed, yet
* To recap, the .gitignore file is used to tell Git about the files that Git should not track. This file should be placed in the same directory that the .git directory is in
    * Globbing lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters
        blank lines can be used for spacing
        # - marks line as a comment
        * - matches 0 or more characters
        ? - matches 1 character
        [abc] - matches a, b, _or_ c
        ** - matches nested directories - a/**/z matches
            a/z
            a/b/z
            a/b/c/z

--------Create a remote git repository ---------
A bare repository is a git repository without a working copy, therefore the content of .git is top-level for that directory.
Use a non-bare repository to work locally and a bare repository as a central server/hub to share your changes with other people. For example, when you create a repository on github.com, it is created as a bare repository.

So, in your computer:
    git init
    touch README
    git add README
    git commit -m "initial commit"

on the server:
    cd /srv/git/project
    git init --bare

Then on the client, you push:
    git push username@server:/srv/git/project master

The repository on the server side is going to get commits via pull and push, and not by you editing files and then commiting them in the server machine, therefore it is a bare repository.
Recommended setup is: use a non-bare repository to work locally and a bare repository as a hub or central server to push and pull from.

-------pushing data into github -------
* Start a new github repository through website
* Run below commands
    # connect origin to the server
    git remote add origin git@github.com:gauravmahal/git_setup.git
    # push local changes from master to remote server
    git push -u origin master
$ git pull
    command is used to get remote repo to local 

--------Tagging --------
$ git tag 
    * command is used to add a marker on a specific commit. The tag does not move around as new commits are added
    * add a tag to the most recent commit
    * add a tag to a specific commit if a SHA is passed

---------Branching and Merging---------
$ git branch
    * command is used to interact with Git's branches
    * It can be used to:
        - list all branch names in the repository
        - create new branches
        - delete branches (-d for deleting and -D for explicit deleting)
$ git checkout 
    * used to switch between branches
    * Running this command will:
        - remove all files and directories from the Working Directory that Git is tracking
            - (files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is lost)
        - go into the repository and pull out all of the files and directories of the commit that the branch points to
$ git reset --hard <branch name >^
    * use this command to undo the merge
    * "Relative Commit Reference" and indicates "the parent commit"
$ git merge <name-of-branch-to-merge-in>
    * When a merge happens, Git will:
        - look at the branches that it's going to merge
        - look back along the branch's history to find a single commit that both branches have in their commit history
        - combine the lines of code that were changed on the separate branches together
        - makes a commit to record the merge
    * There are two types of merges:
        - Fast-forward merge – the branch being merged in must be ahead of the checked out branch. The checked out branch's pointer will just be moved forward to point to the same commit as the other branch.
        - the regular type of merge
            - two divergent branches are combined
            - a merge commit is created
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all

* merge conflict indicators explanation -
    - <<<<<<< HEAD everything below this line (until the next indicator) shows you what's on the current branch
    - ||||||| merged common ancestors everything below this line (until the next indicator) shows you what the original lines were
    - ======= is the end of the original lines, everything that follows (until the next indicator) is what's on the branch that's being merged in
    - >>>>>>> heading-update is the ending indicator of what's on the branch that's being merged in (in this case, the heading-update branch)

-------- Undoing Changes --------
$ git commit --amend
    * modify the last commit 
    * edit, save and stage the file(s)
    * run above command
$ git revert <SHA-of-commit-to-revert>
    * command is used to reverse a previously made commit
    * it will undo the changes that were made by the provided commit
    * it creates a new commit to record the change 
$ git reflog 
    * Git does keep track of everything for about 30 days before it completely erases anything. to access it use above command
* Relative Commit Reference
    - Following special characters called "Ancestry References"
        * ^ – indicates the parent commit
        * ~ – indicates the first parent commit
            for eg. - HEAD^^^2 (this is the grandparent's (HEAD^^) second parent (^2))
$ git reset <reference-to-commit>
    - It can be used to:
        * move the HEAD and current branch pointer to the referenced commit
        * erase commits with the --hard flag
        * moves committed changes to the staging index with the --soft flag
        * unstages committed changes --mixed flag

-------- Things Need to install, How and from where --------
## make

    1- method 
    - Go to [ezwinports](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/).
    - Download `make-4.1-2-without-guile-w32-bin.zip` (get the version without guile).
    - Extract zip.
    - Copy the contents to your `Git\mingw64\` merging the folders, but do NOT overwrite/replace any existing files.

    2- method
    - You have to install mingw-get and after that you can run mingw-get install msys-make to have the command make available.
    - Here is a link for what you want http://www.mingw.org/wiki/getting_started
    - add it the path variable 
    - mingw-get install g++ //start using it
